# Abstract-Data-Types---Python
This repository provides implementations of fundamental Abstract Data Types (ADTs). You can add examples in the main function to test each ADT. For the "Trees" section, there is an interactive simulator in the Python terminal that lets you add, delete, and perform other operations on a Binary Search Tree to understand how it works.

- There is two Jupyter Notebook files in the queues_stacks_algrthm folder which show some example algorithims which use queues and stacks.
